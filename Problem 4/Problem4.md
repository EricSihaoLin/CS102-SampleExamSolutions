| stack.push('p'); | c | A | w | l | p | X | X | X | X | X | Push p onto stack. CAREFUL HERE! The stack is full, but it didn't get a second request  to push additional items, so it will not expand! |
| stack.peek();    | c | A | w | l | p | X | X | X | X | X | Peek will return the top most element, which is character p, but it WILL NOT remove the element                                          |
